# ArbitrageBetting3

# This is a program for finding arbitrage opportunities. It uses theOdds API to get odds from a variety of bookies,
# and then finds the best arbitrage opportunities among them. This version can deal with odds including and not including 
# draws.
#
# It should be noted that arbitrage betting is probably not realistic  way to make money. Profit margins (when they exist)
# are usually very narrow, and you run the risk of having one half of your bet cancelled on you. Not to mention if a bookie
# works out what you're doing you'll probably get banned from betting with them. This was a programming excercise, not a way
# to make money
